# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Prerequisites
1. **Install Node.js**  
   Download and install Node.js (v16 or higher recommended) from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).  
   Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Install Git**  
   Download and install Git from [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/).  
   Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

3. **Install a Code Editor (Optional)**  
   It is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing and running the project.

## Installation and Running Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/joint-circle.git
   cd joint-circle
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # Or if you use yarn:
   # yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Or if you use yarn:
   # yarn dev
   ```

4. **Build for Production**
   To create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Or if you use yarn:
   # yarn build
   ```

5. **Preview the Production Build**
   To preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   # Or if you use yarn:
   # yarn preview
   ```

## Updating the Deployment on GitHub (Optional)
1. Make changes to your code and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

2. Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. If you are using GitHub Pages for deployment, ensure your `vite.config.js` is configured correctly for GitHub Pages. For example:
   ```javascript
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/repository-name/',
     plugins: [react()],
   });
   ```

4. Deploy the updated build to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Requirements
All dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file.

## Additional Notes
- If you encounter issues with permissions during `npm install`, try running the command with `sudo` (Linux/macOS) or as an administrator (Windows).
- Ensure your system's firewall or antivirus is not blocking the development server.
